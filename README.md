This Project is an AI-powered virtual classroom monitoring system that automates student attendance and ensures active participation using real-time facial recognition and behavior analysis. It features a PyQt5-based faculty interface that displays a fullscreen webcam feed alongside a mini student camera stream via UDP, integrates YOLOv8 for face detection, MobileFaceNet and Dlib for facial embedding and alignment, and uses phone detection to flag distractions. A countdown timer tracks session time, while participation is continuously assessed based on facial presence, alignment, and attention, ensuring secure, interactive, and intelligent class monitoring.
